This is the repository for the Analytic Number Theory Exponent Database (ANTEDB), an ongoing project to systematically record known theorems for various exponents appearing in analytic number theory, as well as the relationships between them. Currently, the database is recording facts and conjectures on [exponent pairs](https://teorth.github.io/expdb/blueprint/exponent-pairs-chapter.html), [exponential sum bounds](https://teorth.github.io/expdb/blueprint/beta-chapter.html), [zero-density](https://teorth.github.io/expdb/blueprint/zero-density-chapter.html) and [moment bounds](https://teorth.github.io/expdb/blueprint/zeta-moment-chapter.html) for the Riemann zeta-function, [large value estimates](https://teorth.github.io/expdb/blueprint/largevalue-chapter.html), [additive energy bounds](https://teorth.github.io/expdb/blueprint/energy-chapter.html) and exponents related to [prime distributions](https://teorth.github.io/expdb/blueprint/primes-sec.html), amongst other results (the full list of exponents can be found [here](https://teorth.github.io/expdb/blueprint/intro-chapter.html)). The database aims to organise and record theorems and relationships as both [human-readable proofs](https://teorth.github.io/expdb/blueprint/intro-chapter.html) and as [executable python code](https://github.com/teorth/expdb/tree/main/blueprint/src/python). This builds upon the tables of exponent pairs and other related exponents that were collected in [this paper of Trudgian and Yang](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05599), and aims to fulfil the vision set out in [this blog post of Terence Tao](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2024/07/07/a-computation-outsourced-discussion-of-zero-density-theorems-for-the-riemann-zeta-function/).
