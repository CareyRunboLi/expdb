# code for bounding the function A*(\sigma) in the bound
#
# N*(\sigma - \delta, T) \ll T^{A*(\sigma)(1 - \sigma) + o(1)}
#
# for all \delta > 0, where N(\sigma, T) is the additive energy of 
# the imaginary parts of the zeroes \rho of the Riemann zeta-function 
# satisfying with real part \in [\sigma, 1] and imaginary part \in 
# [-T, T].
